        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>We are proud graduates of NIST University, where our journey into the world of technology and creativity truly began. During our years at NIST (2023â€“2027), we explored different fields of computer science, but we quickly realized that our passion was in web development.

From creating simple HTML pages in the classroom to building dynamic, responsive websites as projects, every step helped us grow in knowledge and confidence. We worked on real-time projects, collaborated as a team, and learned how important design, functionality, and user experience are in building a website.

After passing out from NIST, we decided to take this passion forward by starting our own journey in website development. Today, we build websites that are not only visually appealing but also efficient, user-friendly, and innovative.</p>
